# DO NOT USE THIS YET

this is made public solely as a necessary component of pontiff  
all aspects of it can and will change completely at any time without any notice  
presently being developed inhouse, issues and prs will be ignored

in time tabulae will be an organized alternate stdlib, in the spirit of a haskell custom prelude  
for now it is a mess of utility functions, all of which will be renamed moved or removed several times yet  
caveat lector!
